      <p class="text">How does a panagram start? This starting approach, like the greater pattern as a whole, is a result of each individual&#39;s preference and unique life state. The fact that person one decides to wake up at 4am every morning and person 2 stays up until 4am each night makes no fundamental difference in how panagrams start. It&#39;s necessary here to comment on the cyclical nature of panagrams. Think of a task that you know wouldn&#39;t be finished in a single sitting, or even a handful of sittings. Here are a few examples: writing a book, learning a free throw, achieving a peak rating in a sport or game (Chess, League of Legends, Fantasy Football), performing an annual financial analysis of the top ten largest companies, the list continues. In completing these tasks -- at a level of excellence -- one undoubtedly will spend more than an afternoon or weekend working their way through key exercises in order to produce tangible, quality work.</p>
      
      <p class="text">What this means is, in these tasks you will have to start the practice of deep work, stop, and then start up again at a later time, usually a later day. The panagrammer&#39;s entire philosophy is based on this idea: For progress to be made, repetition will need to become a staple of the routine. This is why it&#39;s critical to be mindful of what this repetition actually looks like. Down to the hour, the minute, the first and last thing you do each day, all of these are important. However, one should give a small caveat here to ask, how big of an impact will the minute to minute routine really have on the quality of work produced. I think a practical answer here is, in many cases the effect will not be detrimental, and when you&#39;re at this phase of routine introspection, it pushes a lot more to the technique of the practice than to the functional value that a single minute in someone&#39;s day can produce. This is can be made much clearer with a simple example -- it also emphasizes the subjective nature of different people&#39;s routines/values/interests. Person One wakes up, checks their phone, sees that they have a few social media notifications, likes a post or two, and gets out of bed. They make coffee and go for a walk, sit down and start to work. Person two does the same thing, except they check the news for a few minutes then begin their day. Person three wakes up and pets their cat/dog for a few minutes. Can something this small change the trajectory of an individual&#39;s entire day?</p>
      
      <p class="text">If the answer to this question is yes, then there needs to be genuine consideration of just how your day is starting. Further yet, there needs to be consideration of how all your routines are starting. Because while that single few minutes in the morning may not have a significant effect on your day, there&#39;s certainly some of them that do, and adding up some of those brief, minute long routines do add up (although the commensurability of one routine or another is definitely in question).</p>
      
      <p class="text">There is something lost in all of this, lost in this sterilized petri dish of a thought experiment. It&#39;s lost here but found in other places. However in these other places, they are not interested in discussing optimal morning routines or pseudo-scientific facts. In these other places, they&#39;re interested in the truth, and its pursuit, those damned why questions. Why are you here, writing that, reading this? Why are you waking up early and staying up late? Why are you set on doing, and how deep will you go? The ground at the surface always has a layer that&#39;s hard to break through. It feels like to even get started you have to put out this herculean effort. But after the surface is broken, the ground opens up into a thick mulch, days and days of earth to move: the surface is broken, now you only need to dig</p>
      
      <p class="text">Is it possible that those first five minutes in the morning could make the difference in that first effort to break through the surface? To be pragmatic, in some ways the actual answer to this question is irrelevant. Mainly because one can make an assumption, a scaling assumption that can be applied to those first five minutes the same way that it could be to a four-hour block of time. If the five minute primer has little effect on your morning should the same be said for the 30 minute primer and its effect on your afternoon?</p>
      
      <p class="text">Granting this assumption, we know the primer is relevant, and given this, we know we must be mindful of those windows. Is it realistic to cut this or that thing from your routine? You know the answer, and that answer, even if it&#39;s just being applied to the 5 minutes in the morning on social media, will come with a sacrifice. Of course, what you stand to gain is consistency in production.</p>
      
      <p class="text">Full disclosure, I&#39;m person three in this early-morning example, except my cat is usually off in the other room, aloof. So I wake up, I don&#39;t check any media, I make some coffee and walk down the trail outside my apartment. I get home, I read a book for a while (usually a chapter), and I write for a while (usually a page or two). This happens every day, from slumber to writing with no unexpected interruptions, just a short exchange with an author who thinks deeply and then I&#39;m off on my own.</p>
