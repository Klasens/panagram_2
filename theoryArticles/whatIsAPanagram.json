      "paragraph": "The Panagram is a span of time where the performer explicitly attempts to maximize deep work over a period of weeks to months. Consider two approaches to a task, say reading and finishing a book. At the end of each approach, the book will have been fully read and all pages will have, to keep the tone sterile and scientific, been processed and consumed. In approach one, the individual begins their day, goes to work, and on their hour-long lunch break they bring out the book and read a single chapter. This takes roughly 15 - 35 minutes depending on the day/chapter. In approach two, the individual wakes up, goes on a 15 - 25 minutes walk, sits down and reads for 15 - 35 minutes finishing a single chapter. In each approach, the individuals accomplish the same task, in roughly the same amount of time. At the end of some long span of time, they've finished the book. The question is, is one of these approaches inherently better than the other?"

    {
      "paragraph": "The point above can be made even clearer (and also more abstractly) if we adjust the task to something more attuned to deep work. Instead of reading, let's shift the task to writing. How effective is the writer going to be if their writing blocks exist only on their lunch hour for 15 - 35 minutes? Being charitable to the idea, we can assume that the individual of this approach is actually able to repeat this lunch hour day after day -- while in reality, the pulls of a 9-5 job and a single lunch hour (that also is supposed to function as a break/mental reset) would make reaching consistency on this difficult. There are always some days where I simply want to disengage from all critical thought during the single hour I'm awarded in that 9-5 life."

    {
      "paragraph": "Now consider approach three: Every morning after waking up, the individual takes a walk, they read a book, then they write for a while. How long do each of these segments last? To continue the thread, we'll say they last about as long as Individual 1's lunch hour. To really understand work as it relates to the Panagram, we should go one step further. Granted, the typical session for individual 1 and 3 averages roughly the same amount of time. But individual 3 can, if they choose, write for longer. They can follow the idea where it takes them instead of setting their timer, and anticipating their return to life. How do these structural lines affect deep work?"

    {
      "paragraph": "This is the space that the Panagramer wants to cultivate. Each person will undoubtedly have a special set of circumstances that they are responsible for living by and managing. It's a critique of all content like this that these types of pages usually graft their own assumptions of how time should be spent. Saying things like, all you have to do is wake up an hour earlier, stay an hour later, quit your job and move out to the wilderness: Certainly, all these methods may lead to more deep work produced, but emphasizing this part of the method misses out on what's fundamental. Deep work is produced by you, on your time."

    {
      "paragraph": "As for me, I did decide to take one of those dramatic steps, giving up what most of management said was a 'very bright career' to focus on my own daily routine. After months of frustration, I saw what I wasn't capable of producing, and I started to realize why I wasn't capable. Wake up, go to work, try to build a relationship, think about what I want to do someday, get tired, and then go to sleep -- this was a day that was repeating itself. And when you break it down like that, where the day in isolation can be seen just for the quality that is produced, I found that there was no quality at all. Somehow, everyone around me was pursuing their vision of success, a vision that (because of my circumstances) I was also pursuing, but as I reached the milestones, none of it felt important, or interesting, or successful: It just felt like I was a relatively productive and profitable cog in the machine So I quit, I quit that job and renegotiated the relationship. I removed the pieces of my life until there was just me, waking up in the morning, a blank calendar in front of me."
    },
    {
      "paragraph": "Consider approach four: The individual wakes up and goes outside for a walk. After feeling energized, they come inside, sit down and read. Once they feel reseted and primed, they pull out the pad and begin to write. How long does this take? Some days it takes an hour, some days it takes three, but to simplify it down to these basic time blocks gives the wrong idea. Because, for individual four, their answer looks different. How long does it take? They will say, it takes me a while, but not too long."
